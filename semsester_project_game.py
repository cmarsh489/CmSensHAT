"""My idea with this is to make a game that has different direction arrows that come at you, and you have to match the direction to "beat" the arrow, much like that tower game I used to play.
The whole game will be set 90 degrees counterclockwise because thatll make it easier to play with all the connections. An arrow with a random direction will come down the screen slowly, and the player has to match that dierction with the joystick when it reaches them, and if they miss, they get a strike.
The arrows will get continously more frequent and faster moving, adding to the difficulty of the game. More to add later"""
